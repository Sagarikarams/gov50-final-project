## Project thoughts
I want to explore USA Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) data. I will be analyzing different trends and patterns that exist in the data. The project shows how inflation is related to unemployment and wage growth. The affect of inflation differs among different industries and cities. It is important to know if inflation is higher than wage growth.
